Math Magic Algorithm
1.	Enter a value below 10.
2.	Then double the number by multiplying it by 2.
3.	After the number is doubled, you add six to it.
4.	Then you divide the number you get after adding six to it by two to get itâ€™s half.
5.	After that the number should be subtracted by the number input in step 1
6.	This process should always result in the final answer being 3.
Tic Tac Toe Algorithm
1.	Create a board with 9 squares
2.	Have the user input either an X or O on one square
3.	Then have the computer always enter the opposite sign of what the user chose somewhere different on the board.
4.	Repeat these steps with each one making the best move possible until there are 3 rows of equal signs either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
